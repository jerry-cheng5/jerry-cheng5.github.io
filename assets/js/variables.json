I’ve created many small websites in my technology courses in highschool, and I decided to take everything I learned to create this website. I took the basics that I learned from school and merged them with various frameworks/libraries such as Bootstrap, Animate.css, Wow.js, JQuery, and more. I also wanted to make this website dynamic, so I also learned about JSON files and how to use them for Web Development. This website served as a practice tool to improve my web development skills as well as a portfolio for my many future projects!",

This sparked the creation of SynergyyBot–A Project Management Discord Bot Built for Students. This bot includes meeting creation, RVSP, reminders, task creation, Google Calendar integration, and more. My friend and I did this by using Discord’s python API, discord.py, as well as SQLite and SQL to store data. We are also hosting this bot on AWS, so that it can be used by many discord servers. We also learned the Google Calendar API to add Google Calendar integration to our bot. We hope that this bot can help with team collaboration during the upcoming school terms.",
